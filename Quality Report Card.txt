Task #3 — RevenueCat Setup (Source-only, flat, GitHub-ready)

Included:
- pubspec.yaml (adds purchases_flutter ^6.25.0)
- lib/common/constants.dart (entitlement + offering IDs, placeholder SDK key)
- lib/services/revenuecat_service.dart (configure, check Pro, purchase, restore)
- lib/features/settings/settings_screen.dart (Upgrade button + Restore)

What this CAN do:
- Compiles and passes CI with placeholder key
- UI shows Free/Pro status; upgrade attempts do nothing until key added
- Safe to upload via GitHub web (drag contents, commit)

What you do later (~20–30 min one-time):
- Create project at https://app.revenuecat.com
- Copy Public SDK Key into RCConstants.publicApiKey
- Create products/offerings in App Store / Play Console and in RevenueCat
- Test purchases via TestFlight / Internal testing

Next task: #4 Environment variables + API keys handling.
