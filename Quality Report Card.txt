Task #2 — Firebase Integration (Source-only, flat, GitHub-ready)

Included:
- pubspec.yaml (firebase_core, firebase_auth, cloud_firestore, firebase_messaging)
- lib/main.dart (Firebase.initializeApp + optional test write)
- lib/firebase_options.dart (placeholder config)
- lib/services/firebase_service.dart (Firestore test read/write)
- .github/workflows/build.yml (unchanged, still valid)

What this CAN do:
- Compiles and passes CI without real credentials
- Pre-wires Firebase for easy setup later
- Lets you upload via GitHub web (drag contents, commit)

What this CANNOT do (your part later, ~45–60 min total):
- Create Firebase project and download google-services.json (Android) and GoogleService-Info.plist (iOS)
- Place those two files in android/app/ and ios/Runner/ and commit
- Optional: run on device to see Firestore 'connected' doc

Next task: #3 RevenueCat subscription setup.
